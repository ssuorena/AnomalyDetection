"AnomalyDetection" on GitHub is a process used to identify patterns that do not conform to expected behavior in datasets.

I can help you create a general README template for an anomaly detection project. Here’s a markdown version of a comprehensive README for such a project:


# 🚨 Anomaly Detection

A Python-based project for detecting anomalies in datasets using various machine learning techniques. This project can be used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, making it useful in fields such as fraud detection, network security, and fault detection in systems.

## 📋 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tools for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implements several algorithms for anomaly detection, such as Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, and more.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of normal vs. anomalous data points.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to different types of datasets (time-series, spatial, etc.).

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssuorena/AnomalyDetection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by placing it in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the main script to perform anomaly detection:

   ```bash
   python detect_anomalies.py --input data/your_dataset.csv
   ```

3. The results will be saved in the `output/` folder, including a report and visualizations.

## 🔍 Algorithm Implemented

- **Isolation Forest**: Efficiently detects anomalies by isolating them in the feature space.

## 📊 Visualization

The project includes various visualization tools to help you understand the distribution of anomalies in your dataset.

- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize anomalies against normal data points.
- **Time-Series Graphs**: Useful for temporal anomaly detection.
